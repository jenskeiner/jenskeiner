<p align="center">I'm a mathematically-minded computer scientist with a passion for efficient and elegant software architecture and development.</p>

👁️ Main interests:

- **Java** and **Python** ecosystems, but I know my way around **C/C++**, **JavaScript**, **TypeScript**, and other languages as well.
- Efficient numerical algorithms. I'm a former contributor to **[NFFT](https://github.com/NFFT/nfft)**, a software library to compute non-equispaced fast Fourier transforms in euclidean and non-euclidean spaces.
- High performance data streaming. I have built event streaming systems using **[Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/)**, **[RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/)**, **[IBM MQ](https://www.ibm.com/de-de/products/mq)**. Particularly, I have built a high-performance market data capture solution using **[Aeron](https://github.com/real-logic/aeron)**, an efficient and reliable UDP-based message transport.
- Efficient and reliable distributed systems.
- Machine learning, particularly the efficacy for forecasting of financial time-series.

🔭 I’m currently working on
  - [`exchange_calendars_extensions`](https://github.com/jenskeiner/exchange_calendars_extensions): A Python package that transparently adds some extension to the [`exchange_calendars`](https://github.com/gerrymanoim/exchange_calendars) package.
  - [`exchange_calendar-service`](https://github.com/jenskeiner/exchange_calendar_service): A [FastAPI](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi)-based web service that builds on top of [`exchange_calendars_extensions`](https://github.com/jenskeiner/exchange_calendars_extensions)
    to provide a simple HTTP API for advanced querying of exchange calendars.
  - [ghcr.io Container Repository Cleanup Action](https://github.com/jenskeiner/ghcr-container-repository-cleanup-action): A GitHub action to perform maintenance on ghcr.io container repositories.

🌱 I’m currently learning
  - various ML-related topics, particularly time-series forecasting and analysis,
  - frontend technologies like Angular or React, without following every hype cycle.

Skills
I hold a doctorate in Mathematics and a German Computer Science Diploma from the University of Lübeck, Germany. In my scientific work, I developed fast algorithms for the discrete spherical Fourier transform and transforms, which combined mathematical results, established by formal proofs, with numerical analysis and actual implementation of the developed algorithms.

Expert in Python and Java development
Quick learner with a passion for learning new programming languages and frameworks
Building high-performance, low-latency systems with a focus on efficiency
Familiarity with various programming languages
Proficient in discovering, evaluating, and using new frameworks within a programming language ecosystem
Foundational knowledge and interest in machine learning, with a particular focus on time-series forecasting and analysis
Professional Career

After my studies, I spent three years working as a consultant in the finance industry, where I advised banks on technical matters. I then spent nearly ten years working for a private bank, where I developed a suite of execution algorithms for equities and was part of a team that built an algorithmic trading engine from the ground up. Later, I focused on data acquisition, processing, and analysis tasks.

Interests

In addition to my work, I enjoy exploring new technologies, experimenting with new programming languages and frameworks, and keeping up with the latest developments in the software development industry.

Feel free to reach out to me on GitHub or LinkedIn to discuss potential collaborations or just to chat!
