Skills
I hold a doctorate in Mathematics and a German Computer Science Diploma from the University of LÃ¼beck, Germany. In my scientific work, I developed fast algorithms for the discrete spherical Fourier transform and transforms, which combined mathematical results, established by formal proofs, with numerical analysis and actual implementation of the developed algorithms.

Expert in Python and Java development
Quick learner with a passion for learning new programming languages and frameworks
Building high-performance, low-latency systems with a focus on efficiency
Familiarity with various programming languages
Proficient in discovering, evaluating, and using new frameworks within a programming language ecosystem
Foundational knowledge and interest in machine learning, with a particular focus on time-series forecasting and analysis
Professional Career

After my studies, I spent three years working as a consultant in the finance industry, where I advised banks on technical matters. I then spent nearly ten years working for a private bank, where I developed a suite of execution algorithms for equities and was part of a team that built an algorithmic trading engine from the ground up. Later, I focused on data acquisition, processing, and analysis tasks.

Interests

In addition to my work, I enjoy exploring new technologies, experimenting with new programming languages and frameworks, and keeping up with the latest developments in the software development industry.

Feel free to reach out to me on GitHub or LinkedIn to discuss potential collaborations or just to chat!
